# Word Search Puzzle Generator
CS project to implement a word search puzzle generator using OOP in Java.

## Features
- Generates word search puzzles from words provided by the user
- Allows the user to input words via the keyboard or a text file
- Generated puzzles can be saved to a text file

## Next features to implement
- Place the largest words in the puzzle grid first to make their placement more likely
- If words aren't placed, add them to a list of unplaced words or remove them from the words array so the user doesn't end up looking for them in the puzzle
